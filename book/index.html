  <p>
  I've just spent a few months taking my company <a href="http://magnific.com/">Magnific</a> through the gruelling (but awesome) <a href="http://techstars.com/">TechStars</a> program. In August we'll be focussing on sales/growth and I'd like to take a short sabbatical for other interesting work.</p>

<p>I'm experienced in design, creative strategy and front-end engineering, and I'll be most useful in smaller companies that can draw from my startup experience.</p>

<p>Here are the dates I'm available:
  </p>

  <ul class="book__list">
    <li>Mon 4th – Friday 8th August</li>
    <li class="booked">Mon 11th – Friday 15th August (Booked)</li>
    <li class="booked">Mon 18th – Friday 22nd August (Booked)</li>
    <li>Mon 25th – Friday 29th August</li>
  </ul>
